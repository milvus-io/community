# New Committer/Maintainer Decision Making Process

**Note:** This document is a work in progress

This doc outlines the process of nominating and voting a maintainer/committer of the Milvus project. The process should be operated transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically. To learn the details about the responsibilities and priviliges of a maintainer/committer, please check the [community membership](https://github.com/milvus-io/community/blob/master/community-membership.md)

## Process Summary
	1. A maintainer nominate a qualified community member, with a notification using call for vote template sent to slack channel and community mailing list.
	2. Close the vote after 7 days
	3. If the result is positive, send the invitation to the new committer/maintainer with the inviting template and wait for response.

	If nominees accept, then:
		1. Change the committer/maintainer list on github
		2. Announce to mailing list and slack channel

## Detailed Process

We do the voting on https://vote.heliosvoting.org/ anonymously to enable a frank discussion. 

Milvus maintainers should start a separate [VOTE] issue for each new contributer/maintainer, detailed templates mentioned in the process appear later in this document.

Anyone could comment on the issue about what we feel about the candidates, with no holds barred. Keep the discussion concise.

The nominator should be responsible to open a voting and send email notification to all maintainers/contributors.

Let the discussion process run for one week, a positive result is achieved by Consensus Approval: at least 3 +1 votes and no vetoes for committer nomination and achieve maintainer quorum for maintainer nomination.

Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning and the vetoer must be prepared to defend it. Other voters can attempt to encourage them to change their mind.

After a positive result, record the result on the Committer/Maintainer list and announce through slack channel/mailing list.
