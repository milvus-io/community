<p>If you build AI tooling for e-commerce sellers, you’ve probably heard this request a thousand times: “I have a new product. Give me a promotional image that looks like it belongs in a bestseller listing. No photographer, no studio, and make it cheap.”</p>
<p>That’s the problem in a sentence. Sellers have flat-lay photos and a catalog of bestsellers that already convert. They want to bridge the two with AI, both fast and at scale.</p>
<p>When Google released Nano Banana 2 (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image) on February 26, 2026, we tested it the same day and integrated it into our existing Milvus-based retrieval pipeline. The result: total image generation cost dropped to roughly one-third of what was spent before, and throughput doubled. The per-image price cut (about 50% cheaper than Nano Banana Pro) accounts for part of that, but the larger savings come from eliminating rework cycles entirely.</p>
<p>This article covers what Nano Banana 2 gets right for e-commerce, where it still falls short, and then walks through a hands-on tutorial for the full pipeline: <strong>Milvus</strong> hybrid search to find visually similar bestsellers, <strong>Qwen</strong> 3.5 for style analysis, and <strong>Nano Banana 2</strong> for final generation.</p>

    </button></h2><p>Nano Banana 2 (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image) launched on February 26, 2026. It brings most of Nano Banana Pro’s capabilities to the Flash architecture, meaning faster generation at a lower price point. Here are the key upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pro-level quality at Flash speed.</strong> Nano Banana 2 delivers world-class knowledge, reasoning, and visual fidelity previously exclusive to Pro, but with the latency and throughput of Flash.</li>
<li><strong>512px to 4K output.</strong> Four resolution tiers (512px, 1K, 2K, 4K) with native support. The 512px tier is new and unique to Nano Banana 2.</li>
<li><strong>14 aspect ratios.</strong> Adds 4:1, 1:4, 8:1, and 1:8 to the existing set (1:1, 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9).</li>
<li><strong>Up to 14 reference images.</strong> Maintains character resemblance for up to 5 characters and object fidelity for up to 14 objects in a single workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Improved text rendering.</strong> Generates legible, accurate in-image text across multiple languages, with support for translation and localization within a single generation.</li>
<li><strong>Image Search grounding.</strong> Pulls from real-time web data and images from Google Search to generate more accurate depictions of real-world subjects.</li>
<li><strong>~50% cheaper per image.</strong> At 1K resolution: <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.067</mn><mi>v</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><msup><mi>o</mi><mo mathvariant="normal" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">′</mo></msup><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.067 versus Pro&#x27;s</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7519em;"></span><span class="mord">0.067</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">v</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ers</span><span class="mord mathnormal">u</span><span class="mord mathnormal">s</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">r</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.7519em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mord mathnormal">s</span></span></span></span>0.134.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Fun Use Case of Nano Banano 2: Generate a Location-Aware Panorama Based On a Simple Google Map Screenshot</strong></p>
<p>Given a Google Maps screenshot and a style prompt, the model recognizes the geographic context and generates a panorama that preserves the correct spatial relationships. Useful for producing region-targeted ad creatives (a Parisian café backdrop, a Tokyo streetscape) without sourcing stock photography.</p>

    </button></h2><p>E-commerce is one of the most image-intensive industries. Product listings, marketplace ads, social creatives, banner campaigns, localized storefronts: every channel demands a constant stream of visual assets, each with its own specs.</p>
<p>The core requirements for AI image generation in e-commerce boil down to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep costs low</strong> – per-image cost has to work at catalog scale.</li>
<li><strong>Match the look of proven bestsellers</strong> – new images should align with the visual style of listings that already convert.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid infringement</strong> – no copying competitors’ creatives or reusing protected assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, cross-border sellers need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-platform format support</strong> – different aspect ratios and specs for marketplaces, ads, and storefronts.</li>
<li><strong>Multilingual text rendering</strong> – clean, accurate in-image text across multiple languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nano Banana 2 comes close to checking every box. The sections below break down what each upgrade means in practice: where it directly solves an e-commerce pain point, where it falls short, and what the actual cost impact looks like.</p>
<h3 id="Cut-Output-Generation-Costs-by-Up-to-60" class="common-anchor-header">Cut Output Generation Costs by Up to 60%</h3><p>At 1K resolution, Nano Banana 2 costs <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.067</mn><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>v</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><msup><mi>o</mi><mo mathvariant="normal" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">′</mo></msup><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.067 per image versus Pro&#x27;s</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.9463em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord">0.067</span><span class="mord mathnormal">p</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">er</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ima</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">v</span><span class="mord mathnormal">ers</span><span class="mord mathnormal">u</span><span class="mord mathnormal">s</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">r</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.7519em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mord mathnormal">s</span></span></span></span>0.134, which is a straight 50% cut. But the per-image price is only half the story. What used to kill user budgets was rework. Every marketplace enforces its own image spec (1:1 for Amazon, 3:4 for Shopify storefronts, ultrawide for banner ads), and producing each variant meant a separate generation pass with its own failure modes.</p>
<p>Nano Banana 2 collapses those extra passes into one.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Four native resolution tiers.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>512px ($0.045)</p></li>
<li><p>1K ($0.067)</p></li>
<li><p>2K ($0.101)</p></li>
<li><p>4K ($0.151).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The 512px tier is new and unique to Nano Banana 2. Users can now generate low-cost 512px drafts for iteration and output the final asset at 2K or 4K without a separate upscaling step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>14 supported aspect ratios</strong> in total. Here are some examples:</p></li>
<li><p>4:1</p></li>
<li><p>1:4</p></li>
<li><p>8:1</p></li>
<li><p>1:8</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These new ultra-wide and ultra-tall ratios join the existing set. One generation session can produce various formats like: <strong>Amazon main image</strong> (1:1), <strong>Storefront hero</strong> (3:4) and <strong>Banner ad</strong> (ultra-wide or other ratios.)</p>
<p>No cropping, no padding, no re-prompting required for these 4 ratios. The remaining 10 aspect ratios are included in the full set, making the process more flexible across different platforms.</p>
<p>The ~50% per-image savings alone would only halve the bill. Eliminating rework across resolutions and aspect ratios is what brought the total cost down to roughly one-third of what was spent before.</p>
<h3 id="Support-Up-to-14-Reference-Images-with-Bestseller-Style" class="common-anchor-header">Support Up to 14 Reference Images with Bestseller Style</h3><p>Of all the Nano Banana 2 updates, multi-reference blending has the biggest impact on our Milvus pipeline. Nano Banana 2 accepts up to 14 reference images in a single request, maintaining:</p>
<ul>
<li>Character resemblance for up to <strong>5 characters</strong></li>
<li>Object fidelity for up to <strong>14 objects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, we retrieved multiple bestseller images from Milvus, passed them in as references, and the generated image inherited their scene composition, lighting, posing, and prop placement. There was no prompt engineering required to reconstruct those patterns by hand.</p>
<p>Previous models supported only one or two references, which forced users to pick a single bestseller to mimic. With 14 reference slots, we could blend characteristics from multiple top-performing listings and let the model synthesize a composite style. This is the capability that makes the retrieval-based pipeline in the tutorial below possible.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="Produce-Premium-Commercial-Ready-Visuals-Without-Traditional-Production-Cost-or-Logistics" class="common-anchor-header">Produce Premium, Commercial-Ready Visuals Without Traditional Production Cost or Logistics</h3><p>For consistent, reliable image generation, avoid dumping all your requirements into a single prompt. A more dependable approach is to work in stages: generate the background first, then the model separately, and finally composite them together.</p>
<p>We tested background generation across all three Nano Banana models with the same prompt: a 4:1 ultrawide rainy-day Shanghai skyline viewed through a window, with the Oriental Pearl Tower visible. This prompt stress-tests composition, architectural detail, and photorealism in a single pass.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h4 id="Original-Nano-Banana-vs-Nano-Banana-Pro-vs-Nano-Banana-2" class="common-anchor-header">Original Nano Banana vs. Nano Banana Pro vs. Nano Banana 2</h4><ul>
<li><strong>Original Nano Banana.</strong> Natural rain texture with believable droplet distribution, but over-smoothed building details. The Oriental Pearl Tower was barely recognizable, and resolution fell short of production requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Nano Banana Pro.</strong> Cinematic atmosphere: warm interior lighting played against cold rain convincingly. However, it omitted the window frame entirely, flattening the image’s sense of depth. Usable as a supporting image, not a hero.</li>
<li><strong>Nano Banana 2.</strong> Rendered the full scene. The window frame in the foreground created depth. The Oriental Pearl Tower was clearly detailed. Ships appeared on the Huangpu River. Layered lighting distinguished interior warmth from exterior overcast. Rain and water-stain textures were near-photographic, and the 4:1 ultrawide ratio held the correct perspective with only minor distortion at the left window edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most background generation tasks in product photography, we found the Nano Banana 2 output usable without post-processing.</p>
<h3 id="Render-In-Image-Text-Cleanly-Across-Languages" class="common-anchor-header">Render In-Image Text Cleanly Across Languages</h3><p>Price tags, promotional banners, and multilingual copy are unavoidable in e-commerce images, and they’ve historically been a breaking point for AI generation. Nano Banana 2 handles them significantly better, supporting in-image text rendering across multiple languages with translation and localization in a single generation.</p>
<p><strong>Standard text rendering.</strong> In our testing, text output was error-free across every e-commerce format we tried: price labels, short marketing taglines, and bilingual product descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Handwriting continuation.</strong> Since e-commerce often requires handwritten elements like price tags and personalized cards, we tested whether the models could match an existing handwritten style and extend it — specifically, matching a handwritten to-do list and adding 5 new items in the same style. Results across three models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Nano Banana.</strong> Repeated sequence numbers, misunderstood structure.</li>
<li><strong>Nano Banana Pro.</strong> Correct layout, but poor font style reproduction.</li>
<li><strong>Nano Banana 2.</strong> Zero errors. Matched stroke weight and letterform style closely enough to be indistinguishable from the source.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <span class="img-wrapper">
    <img translate="no" src="https://assets.zilliz.com/blog-images/image12.png" alt="" class="doc-image" id="" />
    <span></span>
  </span>
</p>
<p><strong>However,</strong> Google’s own documentation notes that Nano Banana 2 “can still struggle with accurate spelling and fine details in images.” Our results were clean across the formats we tested, but any production workflow should include a text verification step before publishing.</p>

    </button></h2><h3 id="Before-we-begin-Architecture-and-Model-Setup" class="common-anchor-header">Before we begin: Architecture and Model Setup</h3><p>To avoid the randomness of single-prompt generation, we split the process into three controllable stages: retrieve what already works with <strong>Milvus</strong> hybrid search, analyze why it works with <strong>Qwen 3.5</strong>, then generate the final image with those constraints baked in with <strong>Nano Banana 2</strong>.</p>
<p>Quick primer on each tool if you haven’t worked with them before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://milvus.io/">Milvus</a></strong><a href="https://milvus.io/">:</a> the most widely adopted open-source vector database. Stores your product catalog as vectors and runs hybrid search (dense + sparse + scalar filters) to find bestseller images most similar to a new product.</li>
<li><strong>Qwen 3.5</strong>: a popular multimodal LLM. Takes retrieved bestseller images and extracts the visual patterns behind them (scene layout, lighting, pose, mood) into a structured style prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Nano Banana 2</strong>: image generation model from Google (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image). Takes three inputs: the new product flat-lay, a bestseller reference, and Qwen 3.5’s style prompt. Outputs the final promotional photo.</li>
</ul>
<p>The logic behind this architecture starts with one observation: the most valuable visual asset in any e-commerce catalog is the library of bestseller images that have already been converted. The poses, compositions, and lighting in those photos were refined through real ad spend. Retrieving those patterns directly is an order of magnitude faster than reverse-engineering them through prompt writing, and that retrieval step is exactly what a vector database handles.</p>
<p>Here is the full flow. We call every model through the OpenRouter API, so there is no local GPU requirement and no model weights to download.</p>

<p>We lean on three Milvus capabilities to make the retrieval stage work:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dense + sparse hybrid search.</strong> We run image embeddings and text TF-IDF vectors as parallel queries, then merge the two result sets with RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) reranking.</li>
<li><strong>Scalar field filtering.</strong> We filter by metadata fields like category and sales_count before vector comparison, so results only include relevant, high-performing products.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-field schema.</strong> We store dense vectors, sparse vectors, and scalar metadata in a single Milvus collection, which keeps the entire retrieval logic in one query instead of scattered across multiple systems.</li>

<p><strong>Why both vector types?</strong> Dense and sparse vectors complement each other. Dense vectors capture visual similarity: color palette, garment silhouette, overall style. Sparse vectors capture keyword semantics: terms like “floral,” “midi,” or “chiffon” that signal product attributes. Combining both produces significantly better retrieval quality than either approach alone.</p>

    </button></h2><p>In this article, we covered what Nano Banana 2 brings to e-commerce image generation, compared it against the original Nano Banana and Pro across real production tasks, and walked through how to build a bestseller-to-image pipeline with Milvus, Qwen 3.5, and Nano Banana 2.</p>
<p>This pipeline has four practical advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Controlled cost, predictable budgets.</strong> The embedding model (Llama Nemotron Embed VL 1B v2) is free on OpenRouter. Nano Banana 2 runs at roughly half the per-image cost of Pro, and native multi-format output eliminates the rework cycles that used to double or triple the effective bill. For e-commerce teams managing thousands of SKUs per season, that predictability means image production scales with the catalog instead of blowing past budget.</li>
<li><strong>End-to-end automation, faster time to listing.</strong> The flow from flat-lay product photo to finished promotional image runs without manual intervention. A new product can go from warehouse photo to marketplace-ready listing image in minutes rather than days, which matters most during peak seasons when catalog turnover is highest.</li>
<li><strong>No local GPU required, lower barrier to entry.</strong> Every model runs through the OpenRouter API. A team with no ML infrastructure and no dedicated engineering headcount can run this pipeline from a laptop. There is nothing to provision, nothing to maintain, and no upfront hardware investment.</li>
<li><strong>Higher retrieval precision, stronger brand consistency.</strong> Milvus combines dense, sparse, and scalar filtering in a single query, consistently outperforming single-vector approaches for product matching. In practice, this means generated images more reliably inherit your brand’s established visual language: the lighting, composition, and styling that your existing bestsellers already proved converts. The output looks like it belongs in your store, not like generic AI stock art.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also limitations worth being upfront about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Garment-to-body blending.</strong> Single-pass generation can make clothing look composited rather than worn. Fine details like small accessories sometimes blur. Workaround: generate in stages (background first, then model pose, then composite). This multi-pass approach gives each step a narrower scope and significantly improves blending quality.</li>
<li><strong>Detail fidelity on edge cases.</strong> Accessories, patterns, and text-heavy layouts can lose sharpness. Workaround: add explicit constraints to the generation prompt (“clothing fits naturally on the body, no exposed labels, no extra elements, product details are sharp”). If quality still falls short on a specific product, switch to Nano Banana Pro for the final</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://milvus.io/">Milvus</a> is the open-source vector database powering the hybrid search step, and if you want to poke around or try swapping in your own product photos, the <a href="https://milvus.io/docs"></a><a href="https://milvus.io/docs">quickstart</a> takes about ten minutes. We’ve got a pretty active community on <a href="https://discord.gg/milvus"></a><a href="https://discord.gg/milvus">Discord</a> and Slack, and we’d love to see what people build with this. And if you end up running Nano Banana 2 against a different product vertical or a bigger catalog, please share the results! We’d love to hear about them.</p>
