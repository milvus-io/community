{"codeList":["<think>\n\nAlright, so I need to break down the question \"How has the cast changed over time?\" related to the evolution of The Simpsons. Let me think about what aspects are involved here.\n\nFirst, I know that the cast has changed a lot, but I need to figure out the intermediate questions to approach this. The main question is about changes in the cast over time, so I should consider different areas that contribute to this change.\n\nI guess the first sub-question would be about the original cast members. Who were the main voices and how did they evolve? Then, there might be new cast additions over the years, so another sub-question about that.\n\nAlso, some original voice actors have left, so I should include a sub-question about departures. Then, new voice actors joining would be another point.\n\nThe show has been popular for a long time, so recurring roles changing might be another aspect. Additionally, the role of the show in society might have influenced casting choices, so a sub-question about that.\n\nLastly, the overall impact on the cast's careers could be another angle. So, I should list these as sub-questions to cover all aspects.\n\n</think>\n","wiki_wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia(user_agent='MilvusDeepResearchBot (<insert your email>)', language='en')\npage_py = wiki_wiki.page(page_title)\n\ntext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=200)\ndocs = text_splitter.create_documents([page_py.text])\n\nvectorstore = Milvus.from_documents(  # or Zilliz.from_documents\n    documents=docs,\n    embedding=embeddings,\n    connection_args={\n        \"uri\": \"./milvus_demo.db\",\n    },\n    drop_old=True, \n    index_params={\n        \"metric_type\": \"COSINE\",\n        \"index_type\": \"FLAT\",  \n        \"params\": {},\n    },\n)\n","# Define the RAG chain for response generation\nrag_chain = (\n    {\"context\": retriever | format_docs, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}\n    | prompt\n    | llm\n    | StrOutputParser()\n)\n\n# Prompt the RAG for each question\nanswers = {}\ntotal = len(leaves(breakdown))\n\npbar = tqdm(total=total)\nfor k, v in breakdown.items():\n    if v == []:\n        print(k)\n        answers[k] = rag_chain.invoke(k).split('</think>')[-1].strip()\n        pbar.update(1)\n    else:\n        for q in v:\n            print(q)\n            answers[q] = rag_chain.invoke(q).split('</think>')[-1].strip()\n            pbar.update(1)\n"],"headingContent":"A Minimal Agent for Online Research","anchorList":[{"label":"¿Cómo funciona?","href":"How-does-it-work","type":2,"isActive":false},{"label":"¿Puedo crear mi propia IA?","href":"Can-I-build-my-own","type":2,"isActive":false},{"label":"Resultados","href":"Results","type":2,"isActive":false},{"label":"Resumen: Lo que hemos construido y lo que queda por hacer","href":"Summary-What-we-built-and-what’s-next","type":2,"isActive":false},{"label":"Recursos","href":"Resources","type":2,"isActive":false}]}
