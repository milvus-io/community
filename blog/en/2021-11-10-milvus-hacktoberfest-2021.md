# It's a Wrap - Milvus Hacktoberfest 2021

![img](https://assets.zilliz.com/Blog_cover_a6ce8748d7.jpeg)

Hacktoberfest has come to an end but there is no end to contributing to open-source projects!


Throughout October, we had a total of **44 pull requests** (PRs) across our repos from **36 contributors** (excluding our core team). Though it is the first year for the Milvus community to join Hacktoberfest, the number of participants we saw was beyond our expectation, an indication of the growing awareness of open-source spirit.

We hope everyone who participated in this event gained some hands-on experience or knowledge of open source, community, and helpful technical skills  in the process.️️️

In this post, we’d like to invite you to celebrate our achievements together and how to continue to contribute to Milvus after Hacktoberfest.

## **📣 Shout out to our contributors:**

During Hacktoberfest this year, the Milvus project repositories saw **44 pull requests merged**! This is a huge accomplishment on all sides. Good job, everyone! 🎉
