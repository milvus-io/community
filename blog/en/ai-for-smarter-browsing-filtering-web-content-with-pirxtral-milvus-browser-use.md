As a Developer Advocate for Milvus, I spend a lot of time on Socials, listening to what people have to say about us and if I can help as well. There is a slight clash of worlds though when you look for "Milvus". It is both a Vector DB and genus of bird, meaning that one moment I'm deep in a thread about vector similarity algorithms, the next I'm admiring stunning photographs of black birds flying through the sky.

While both topics are interesting, mixing them up isn't really helpful in my case, what if there was a smart way to solve this problem without me having to check manually?

Let's build something smarter - by combining visual understanding with context awareness, we can build an assistant that knows the difference between a black kite's migration patterns and a new article from us.


## The tech stack

We combine three different technologies:

- **Browser-Use:** This tool navigates various websites (e.g., Twitter) to fetch content.
- **Pixtral**: A vision-language model that analyzes images and context. In this example, it distinguishes between a technical diagram about our Vector DB and a stunning bird photograph.
- **Milvus:** A high performance and open-source Vector DB. His is where we will store the relevant posts for later querying.

## Seeing it in action

Let's have a look at those 2 posts:

![](https://assets.zilliz.com/Langchian_tweet_1_with_Milvus_f2bd988503.png)![](https://assets.zilliz.com/Tweet_2_with_Bird_4b534efced.png)

For the one on the left, Pixtral recognizes that this is a post about Milvus, the Vector DB. It mentioned some implementation details, but also an image showing a system diagram, indicating that this is indeed, about the Vector DB. We can see below that Pixtral also thinks the same. 

```Shell

The one on the right on the other hand isn't, we can see that this picture, as beautiful as it is, isn't about a Vector DB. We can see a bird flying in the sky, therefore, Pixtral will consider this one irrelevant.

```Shell
INFO     [src.agent.custom_agent] üß† New Memory: The post and comments primarily discuss photography and birds. No references to Milvus the Vector Database are found.
INFO     [src.agent.custom_agent] ‚è≥ Task Progress:
Navigated to the post. Analyzed the content for relevance to Milvus, the Vector DB. No relevant information found.
INFO     [src.agent.custom_agent] ü§î Thought: The content of the post and comments only discusses birds and photography. Since the task specifies ignoring such topics, there is no relevant information for Milvus, the Vector DB. The task can now be concluded.
INFO     [src.agent.custom_agent] üéØ Summary: The post does not contain relevant information for Milvus, the Vector DB. I will conclude the task.
INFO     [src.agent.custom_agent] üõ†Ô∏è  Action 1/1: {"done":{"text":"The post and comments focus on birds and photography. No relevant information related to Milvus, the Vector DB, was found."}}

```

Now that we have filtered out the posts we don't want, we can save the relevant ones in Milvus. Making it possible to query them later using either Vector Search or Full Text Search.

## Storing Data in Milvus

[Dynamic Fields](https://milvus.io/docs/enable-dynamic-field.md#Dynamic-Field) are a must in this case because it's not always possible to respect the schema that Milvus expects. With Milvus, you just use `enable_dynamic_field=True` when creating your schema, and that's it. Here is a code snippet to showcase the process:

```Python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient

# Connect to Milvus
client = MilvusClient(uri="http://localhost:19530")

# Create a Schema that handles Dynamic Fields
schema = self.client.create_schema(enable_dynamic_field=True)
schema.add_field(field_name="id", datatype=DataType.INT64, is_primary=True, auto_id=True)
schema.add_field(field_name="text", datatype=DataType.VARCHAR, max_length=65535, enable_analyzer=True)
schema.add_field(field_name="vector", datatype=DataType.FLOAT_VECTOR, dim=384)
schema.add_field(field_name="sparse", datatype=DataType.SPARSE_FLOAT_VECTOR)
```

Then we define the data we want to have access to:

```Python
# Prepare data with dynamic fields
data = {
    'text': content_str,
    'vector': embedding,
    'url': url,
    'type': content_type,
    'metadata': json.dumps(metadata or {})
}

# Insert into Milvus
self.client.insert(
    collection_name=self.collection_name,
    data=[data]
)
```

This simple setup means you don‚Äôt have to worry about every field being perfectly defined upfront. Just set up the schema to allow for dynamic additions and let Milvus do the heavy lifting.


## Conclusion

By combining Browser Use's web navigation, Pixtral's visual understanding, and Milvus's efficient storage, we've built an intelligent assistant that truly understands context. Now I am using it to distinguish between birds and vector DB, but the same approach could help with another problem you may be facing.

On my end, I wanna continue working on agents that can help me in my daily work in order to reduce my cognitive load üòå
