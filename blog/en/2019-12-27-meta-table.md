## Fields in the Metadata Table

In the last blog, we mentioned how to view your metadata using MySQL or SQLite. This article mainly intends to introduce in detail the fields in the metadata tables.

### Fields in the "`Tables`” table

Take SQLite as an example. The following result comes from 0.5.0. Some fields are added to 0.6.0, which will be introduced later. There is a row in `Tables` specifying a 512-dimensional vector table with the name `table_1`. When the table is created, `index_file_size` is 1024 MB, `engine_type` is 1 (FLAT), `nlist` is 16384, `metric_type` is 1 (Euclidean distance L2). `id` is the unique identifier of the table. `state` is the state of the table with 0 indicating a normal state. `created_on` is the creation time. `flag` is the flag reserved for internal use.

The following table shows field types and descriptions of the fields in `Tables`.

| Field Name        | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`              | int64     | Unique identifier of the vector table. `id` automatically increments.                                                                                                                       |
| `table_id`        | string    | Name of the vector table. `table_id` must be user-defined and follow Linux filename guidelines.                                                                                             |
| `state`           | int32     | State of the vector table. 0 stands for normal and 1 stands for deleted (soft delete).                                                                                                      |
| `dimension`       | int16     | Vector dimension of the vector table. Must be user-defined.                                                                                                                                 |
| `created_on`      | int64     | Number of milliseconds from Jan 1, 1970 to the time when the table is created.                                                                                                              |
| `flag`            | int64     | Flag for internal use, such as whether the vector id is user-defined. The default is 0.                                                                                                     |
| `index_file_size` | int64     | If the size of a data file reaches `index_file_size`, the file is not combined and is used to build indexes. The default is 1024 (MB).                                                      |
| `engine_type`     | int32     | Type of index to build for a vector table. The default is 0, which specifies invalid index. 1 specifies FLAT. 2 specifies IVFLAT. 3 specifies IVFSQ8. 4 specifies NSG. 5 specifies IVFSQ8H. |
| `nlist`           | int32     | Number of clusters the vectors in each data file are divided into when the index is being built. The default is 16384.                                                                      |
| `metric_type`     | int32     | Method to compute vector distance. 1 specifies Euclidean distance (L1) and 2 specifies inner product.                                                                                       |

Table partitioning is enabled in 0.6.0 with a few new fields, including `owner_table`，`partition_tag` and `version`. A vector table, `table_1`, has a partition called `table_1_p1`, which is also a vector table. `partition_name` corresponds to `table_id`. Fields in a partition table are inherited from the owner table, with the `owner table` field specifying the name of the owner table and the `partition_tag` field specifying the tag of the partition.

![tables_new](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/community/master/blog/assets/metadata/tables_new.png "New tables.")

The following table shows new fields in 0.6.0:

| Field Name      | Data Type | Description                                        |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner_table`   | string    | Parent table of the partition.                     |
| `partition_tag` | string    | Tag of the partition. Must not be an empty string. |
| `version`       | string    | Milvus version.                                    |

### Fields in the “`TableFiles"` table

The following example contains two files, which both belong to the `table_1` vector table. The index type (`engine_type`) of the first file is 1 (FLAT); file status (`file_type`) is 7 (backup of the original file); `file_size` is 411200113 bytes; number of vector rows is 200,000. The index type of the second file is 2 (IVFLAT); file status is 3 (index file). The second file is actually the index of the first file. We will introduce more information in upcoming articles.

The following table shows fields and descriptions of `TableFiles`:
