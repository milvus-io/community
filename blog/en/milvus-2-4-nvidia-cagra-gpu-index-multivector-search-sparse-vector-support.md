We are happy to announce the launch of Milvus 2.4, a major advancement in enhancing search capabilities for large-scale datasets. This latest release adds new features, such as support for the GPU-based CAGRA index, beta support for [sparse embeddings](https://zilliz.com/learn/sparse-and-dense-embeddings), group search, and various other improvements in search capabilities. These developments reinforce our commitment to the community by offering developers like you a powerful and efficient tool for handling and querying vector data. Let's jump into the key benefits of Milvus 2.4 together.


## Enabled Multi-vector Search for Simplified Multimodal Searches

Milvus 2.4 provides multivector search capability, allowing simultaneous search and reranking of different vector types within the same Milvus system. This feature streamlines multimodal searches, significantly enhancing recall rates and enabling developers to effortlessly manage intricate AI applications with varied data types. Additionally, this functionality simplifies the integration and fine-tuning of custom reranking models, aiding in the creation of advanced search functions like precise [recommender systems](https://zilliz.com/vector-database-use-cases/recommender-system) that utilize insights from multidimensional data.

Multivector support in Milvus has two components: 

1. The ability to store/query multiple vectors for a single entity within a collection, which is a more natural way to organize data 

2. The ability to build/optimize a reranking algorithm by leveraging the prebuilt reranking algorithms in Milvus

Besides being a highly [requested feature](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/issues/25639), we built this capability because the industry is moving towards multimodal models with the release of GPT-4 and Claude 3. Reranking is a commonly used technique to further improve query performance in search. We aimed to make it easy for developers to build and optimize their rerankers within the Milvus ecosystem.


## Grouping Search Support for Enhanced Compute Efficiency 

The Grouping Search feature in Milvus integrates a groupby operation designed for fields of types BOOL, INT, or VARCHAR. Sparked by a direct appeal from the open-source community (referenced in GitHub issue [#25343](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/issues/25343)), this feature fills a crucial efficiency gap in executing large-scale grouping queries. Traditionally, developers relied on extensive topK searches followed by manual post-processing to distill group-specific results, a method that was both compute-intensive and code-heavy. Grouping Search refines this by efficiently linking query outcomes to aggregate group identifiers like document or video names, streamlining the handling of segmented entities within larger datasets.

Milvus distinguishes its Grouping Search with an iterator-based implementation, offering a marked improvement in computational efficiency over similar technologies. This choice ensures superior performance scalability, particularly in production environments where the optimization of compute resources is paramount. By reducing data traversal and computation overhead, Milvus supports more efficient query processing, significantly reducing response times and operational costs compared to other vector databases. This approach not only bolsters Milvus's capability in managing high-volume, complex queries but also aligns with high-performance computing practices for robust data management solutions.

## Beta Support for Sparse Vector Embeddings

Milvus is set to enhance its capabilities with the introduction of sparse embedding support. This feature targets the efficient execution of approximate semantic nearest neighbor searches over sparse embeddings, which are generated by advanced neural models like SPLADEv2 or statistical models such as BM25. The feature, which entered beta in version 2.4, is aimed for general availability (GA) in version 3.0.

[Sparse embeddings](https://zilliz.com/learn/sparse-and-dense-embeddings) represent a paradigm shift from traditional dense vector approaches, catering to the nuances of semantic similarity rather than mere keyword frequency. This distinction allows for a more nuanced search capability, aligning closely with the semantic content of the query and the documents. Sparse vector models, particularly useful in information retrieval and natural language processing, offer superior out-of-domain search capabilities and interpretability compared to their dense counterparts. In Milvus, sparse vectors are managed similarly to dense vectors, involving the creation of collections with sparse vector columns, data insertion, index creation, and execution of similarity searches.

Sparse embeddings in Milvus are compatible with the Inner Product (IP) distance metric, considering the high dimensionality of these vectors, which renders other distance metrics less practical. This support extends to data types where the dimension is an unsigned 32-bit integer, and the value part is a 32-bit float, accommodating a wide range of applications from keyword-aware text search to comprehensive information retrieval systems.

## CAGRA Index Support for Advanced GPU-Accelerated Graph Indexing

Developed by NVIDIA, [CAGRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15136) (Cuda Anns GRAph-based) is a GPU-based graph indexing technology that significantly surpasses traditional CPU-based methods like the HNSW index in efficiency and performance, especially in high-throughput environments.

With the introduction of the CAGRA Index, Milvus 2.4 provides enhanced GPU-accelerated graph indexing capability. This enhancement is ideal for building similarity search applications requiring minimal latency. Additionally, Milvus 2.4 integrates a brute-force search with the CAGRA index to achieve maximum recall rates in applications. For detailed insights, explore the [introduction blog on CAGRA](https://zilliz.com/blog/Milvus-introduces-GPU-index-CAGRA).

## Additional Enhancements and Features

Milvus 2.4 also includes other key enhancements, such as Regular Expression support for enhanced substring matching in [metadata filtering](https://zilliz.com/blog/metadata-filtering-with-zilliz-cloud-pipelines), a new scalar inverted index for efficient scalar data type filtering, and a Change Data Capture tool for monitoring and replicating changes in Milvus collections. These updates collectively enhance Milvus's performance and versatility, making it a comprehensive solution for complex data operations.
