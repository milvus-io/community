In 2014, DigitalOcean initiated [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) with the idea of celebrating open source software projects. Through the years, the event has steadily grown from tens to thousands of participants.  This, years the month-long event looks to grow to over 200,000 active participants!  

Starting October 1st, everyone from seasoned developers to students, code newbies and tech writers to UX designers, can contribute to open source communities and develop their skills, with the perks of winning limited edition swag and more.
