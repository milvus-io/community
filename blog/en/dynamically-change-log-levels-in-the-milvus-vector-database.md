To prevent an over-output of logs from affecting disk and system performance, Milvus by default outputs logs at the `info` level while running. However, sometimes logs at the `info` level are not sufficient enough to help us efficiently identify bugs and issues. What's worse, in some cases, changing the log level and restarting the service might lead to the failure of reproducing the issues, making troubleshooting all the more difficult. Consequently, the support for changing log levels dynamically in the Milvus vector database is urgently needed.

This article aims to introduce the mechanism behind that enables changing log levels dynamically and provide instructions on how to do so in the Milvus vector database.

## Mechanism

The Milvus vector database adopts the [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) logger open sourced by Uber. As one the most powerful log components in the Go language ecosystem, zap incorporates an [http_handler.go](https://github.com/uber-go/zap/blob/master/http_handler.go) module so that you can view the current log level and dynamically change the log level via an HTTP interface.

Milvus listens the HTTP service provided by the `9091` port. Therefore, you can access the `9091` port to take advantage such features as performance debugging, metrics, health checks. Similarly, the `9091` port is reused to enable dynamic log level modification and a `/log/level` path is also added to the port. See the[ log interface PR](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/pull/18430) or the [source code](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/blob/master/internal/log/log.go#L69-L73) for more information.

## How to dynamically change log levels

This section provides instructions on how to dynamically change log levels without the need the restarting the running Milvus service.

### Prerequisite

Ensure that you can access the `9091` port of Milvus components.

### Change the log level

Suppose the IP address of the Milvus proxy is `192.168.48.12`. 

You can first run `$ curl -X GET 192.168.48.12:9091/log/level` to check the current log level of the proxy.

Then you can make adjustments by specifying the log level. Log level options include: 

- `debug`

- `info`

- `warn`

- `error`

- `dpanic`

- `panic`

- `fatal`.

The following example code changes the log level from the default log level from `info` to `error`. 

```Python
$ curl -X PUT 192.168.48.12:9091/log/level -d level=error
```
