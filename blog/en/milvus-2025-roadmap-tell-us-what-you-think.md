Hey, Milvus users and contributors!

We're excited to share our [**Milvus 2025 roadmap**](https://milvus.io/docs/roadmap.md) with you. ðŸš€ This technical plan highlights the key features and improvements weâ€™re building to make Milvus even more powerful for your vector search needs.

But this is just the beginningâ€”we want your insights! Your feedback helps shape Milvus, ensuring it evolves to meet real-world challenges. Let us know what you think and help us refine the roadmap as we move forward.


## The Current Landscape

Over the past year, we've seen many of you build impressive RAG and agent applications with Milvus, leveraging many of our popular features, such as our model integration, full-text search, and hybrid search. Your implementations have provided valuable insights into real-world vector search requirements.

As AI technologies evolve, your use cases are becoming more sophisticated - from basic vector search to complex multimodal applications spanning intelligent agents, autonomous systems, and embodied AI. These technical challenges are informing our roadmap as we continue to develop Milvus to meet your needs.


## Two Major Releases in 2025: Milvus 2.6 and Milvus 3.0Â 

In 2025, weâ€™re rolling out two major versions: Milvus 2.6 (Middle of CY25) and Milvus 3.0 (end of 2025).Â 

**Milvus 2.6** focuses on core architecture improvements you've been asking for:

- Simpler deployment with fewer dependencies (goodbye, deployment headaches!)

- Faster data ingestion pipelines

- Lower storage costs (we hear your production cost concerns)

- Better handling of large-scale data operations (delete/modify)

- More efficient scalar and full-text search

- Support for the latest embedding models you're working with

**Milvus 3.0** is our bigger architectural evolution, introducing a vector data lake system for:

- Seamless AI service integration

- Next-level search capabilities

- More robust data management

- Better handling of those massive offline datasets you're working with


## Technical Features We're Planning - We Need Your Feedback

Below are key technical features we are planning to add to Milvus.Â
