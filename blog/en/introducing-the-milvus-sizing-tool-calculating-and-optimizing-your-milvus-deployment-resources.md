## Introduction

Selecting the optimal configuration for your Milvus deployment is critical for performance optimization, efficient resource utilization, and cost management. Whether you're building a prototype or planning a production deployment, properly sizing your Milvus instance can mean the difference between a smoothly running vector database and one that struggles with performance or incurs unnecessary costs.

To simplify this process, we've revamped our [Milvus Sizing Tool](https://milvus.io/tools/sizing), a user-friendly calculator that generates recommended resource estimations based on your specific requirements. In this guide, we'll walk you through using the tool and provide deeper insights into the factors that influence the Milvus performance.


## How to Use the Milvus Sizing Tool

It‚Äôs super easy to use this sizing tool. Simply follow the following steps. 

1. Visit the[ Milvus Sizing Tool](https://milvus.io/tools/sizing/) page.

2. Enter your key parameters:

   - Number of vectors and dimensions per vector

   - Index type

   - Scalar field data size

   - Segment size

   - Your preferred deployment mode

3. Review the generated resource recommendations

Let's explore how each of these parameters impacts your Milvus deployment.


## Index Selection: Balancing Storage, Cost, Accuracy, and Speed

Milvus offers various index algorithms, including [HNSW](https://zilliz.com/learn/hierarchical-navigable-small-worlds-HNSW), FLAT, IVF_FLAT, IVF_SQ8, [ScaNN](https://zilliz.com/learn/what-is-scann-scalable-nearest-neighbors-google), [DiskANN](https://zilliz.com/learn/DiskANN-and-the-Vamana-Algorithm), and more, each with distinct trade-offs in memory usage, disk space requirements, query speed, and search accuracy. 

Here's what you need to know about the most common options:

![index](https://assets.zilliz.com/index_dde661d579.jpeg)


HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)

- **Architecture**: Combines skip lists with Navigable Small Worlds (NSWs) graphs in a hierarchical structure

- **Performance**: Very fast querying with excellent recall rates

- **Resource Usage**: Requires the most memory per vector (highest cost)

- **Best For**: Applications where speed and accuracy are critical and memory constraints are less of a concern

- **Technical Note**: The Search begins at the topmost layer with the fewest nodes and traverses downward through increasingly dense layers

FLAT

- **Architecture**: Simple exhaustive search with no approximation

- **Performance**: 100% recall but extremely slow query times (`O(n)` for data size `n`)

- **Resource Usage**: Index size equals the raw vector data size

- **Best For**: Small datasets or applications requiring perfect recall

- **Technical Note**: Performs complete distance calculations between the query vector and every vector in the database

IVF_FLAT

- **Architecture**: Divides vector space into clusters for more efficient searching

- **Performance**: Medium-high recall with moderate query speed (slower than HNSW but faster than FLAT)

- **Resource Usage**: Requires less memory than FLAT but more than HNSW

- **Best For**: Balanced applications where some recall can be traded for better performance

- **Technical Note**: During search, only `nlist`  clusters are examined, significantly reducing computation

IVF_SQ8

- **Architecture**: Applies scalar quantization to IVF_FLAT, compressing vector data

- **Performance**: Medium recall with medium-high query speed

- **Resource Usage**: Reduces disk, compute, and memory consumption by 70-75% compared to IVF_FLAT

- **Best For**: Resource-constrained environments where accuracy can be slightly compromised

- **Technical Note**: Compresses 32-bit floating-point values to 8-bit integer values


### Advanced Index Options: ScaNN, DiskANN, CAGRA, and more 

For developers with specialized requirements, Milvus also offers:

- [**ScaNN**](https://zilliz.com/learn/what-is-scann-scalable-nearest-neighbors-google): 20% faster on CPU than HNSW with similar recall rates

- [**DiskANN**](https://milvus.io/docs/disk_index.md): A hybrid disk/memory index that's ideal when you need to support a large number of vectors with high recall and can accept slightly longer latency (~100ms). It balances memory usage with performance by keeping only part of the index in memory while the rest remains on disk.

- **GPU-based indexes**:

  - [GPU_CAGRA](https://zilliz.com/blog/Milvus-introduces-GPU-index-CAGRA): This is the fastest of the GPU indexes, but it requires an inference card with GDDR memory rather than one with HBM memory

  - GPU_BRUTE_FORCE: Exhaustive search implemented on GPU

  - GPU_IVF_FLAT: GPU-accelerated version of IVF_FLAT

  - GPU_IVF_PQ: GPU-accelerated version of IVF with [Product Quantization](https://zilliz.com/learn/harnessing-product-quantization-for-memory-efficiency-in-vector-databases)

- **HNSW-PQ/SQ/PRQ**: 

  - **HNSW_SQ**: Very high-speed query, limited memory resources; accepts minor compromise in recall rate. 

  - **HNSW_PQ**: Medium speed query; Very limited memory resources; Accepts minor compromise in recall rate

  - **HNSW_PRQ**: Medium speed query; Very limited memory resources; Accepts minor compromise in recall rate

  - **AUTOINDEX**: Defaults to HNSW in open-source Milvus (or uses higher-performing proprietary indexes in [Zilliz Cloud](https://zilliz.com/cloud), the managed Milvus).

- **Binary, Sparse, and other specialized indexes**: For specific data types and use cases. See [this index doc page](https://milvus.io/docs/index.md) for more details. 


## Segment Size and Deployment Configuration

Segments are the fundamental building blocks of Milvus's internal data organization. They function as data chunks that enable distributed search and load balancing across your deployment. This Milvus sizing tool offers three segment size options (512 MB, 1024 MB, 2048 MB), with 1024 MB as the default.

Understanding segments is crucial for performance optimization. As a general guideline:

- 512 MB segments: Best for query nodes with 4-8 GB memory

- 1 GB segments: Optimal for query nodes with 8-16 GB memory

- 2 GB segments: Recommended for query nodes with >16 GB memory

Developer Insight: Fewer, larger segments typically deliver faster search performance. For large-scale deployments, 2 GB segments often provide the best balance between memory efficiency and query speed.


## Message Queue System Selection

When choosing between Pulsar and Kafka as your messaging system:

- **Pulsar**: Recommended for new projects due to lower overhead per topic and better scalability

- **Kafka**: May be preferable if you already have Kafka expertise or infrastructure in your organization


## Enterprise Optimizations in Zilliz Cloud

For production deployments with strict performance requirements, Zilliz Cloud (the fully managed and enterprise version of Milvus on the cloud) offers additional optimizations in indexing and quantization:

- **Out of Memory (OOM) Prevention:** Sophisticated memory management to prevent out-of-memory crashes

- **Compaction Optimization**: Improves search performance and resource utilization

- **Tiered Storage**: Efficiently manage hot and cold data with appropriate compute units

  - Standard compute units (CUs) for frequently accessed data

  - Tiered storage CUs for cost-effective storage of rarely accessed data

For detailed enterprise sizing options, visit the[ Zilliz Cloud service plans documentation](https://docs.zilliz.com/docs/select-zilliz-cloud-service-plans).


## Advanced Configuration Tips for Developers

1. **Multiple Index Types**: The sizing tool focuses on a single index. For complex applications requiring different index algorithms for various collections, create separate collections with custom configurations.

2. **Memory Allocation**: When planning your deployment, account for both vector data and index memory requirements. HNSW typically requires 2-3x the memory of the raw vector data.

3. **Performance Testing**: Before finalizing your configuration, benchmark your specific query patterns on a representative dataset.

4. **Scale Considerations**: Factor in future growth. It's easier to start with slightly more resources than to reconfigure later.


## Conclusion

The[ Milvus Sizing Tool](https://milvus.io/tools/sizing/) provides an excellent starting point for resource planning, but remember that every application has unique requirements. For optimal performance, you'll want to fine-tune your configuration based on your specific workload characteristics, query patterns, and scaling needs.
