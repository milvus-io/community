AI coding assistants are exploding. In just the last two years, tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Qwen Code have gone from curiosities to everyday companions for millions of developers. But behind this rapid rise lies a brewing fight over something deceptively simple: **how should an AI coding assistant actually search your codebase for context?** 

Right now, there are two approaches:

- **Vector search-powered RAG** (semantic retrieval).

- **Keyword search with grep** (literal string matching).

Claude Code and Gemini have chosen the latter. In fact, a Claude engineer openly admitted on Hacker News that Claude Code doesn‚Äôt use RAG at all. Instead, it just greps your repo line by line (what they call ‚Äúagentic search‚Äù)‚Äîno semantics, no structure, just raw string matching.

![](https://assets.zilliz.com/1_2b03e89759.png)

That revelation split the community:

- **Supporters** defend grep‚Äôs simplicity. It‚Äôs fast, exact, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîpredictable. With programming, they argue, precision is everything, and today‚Äôs embeddings are still too fuzzy to trust.

- **Critics** see grep as a dead end. It drowns you in irrelevant matches, burns tokens, and stalls your workflow. Without semantic understanding, it‚Äôs like asking your AI to debug blindfolded.

Both sides have a point. And after building and testing my own solution, I can say this: vector search-based RAG approach changes the game. **Not only does it make search dramatically faster and more accurate, but it also reduces token usage by 40% or more. (Skip to the Claude Context part for my approach)** 

So why is grep so limiting? And how can vector search actually deliver better results in practice? Let‚Äôs break it down.


## What‚Äôs Wrong with Claude Code‚Äôs Grep-Only Code Search?

I ran into this problem while debugging a thorny issue. Claude Code fired off grep queries across my repo, dumping giant blobs of irrelevant text back at me. One minute in, I still hadn‚Äôt found the relevant file. Five minutes later, I finally had the right 10 lines‚Äîbut they‚Äôd been buried in 500 lines of noise.

![](https://assets.zilliz.com/2_299eeeaea5.png)

That‚Äôs not an edge case. Skimming Claude Code‚Äôs GitHub issues shows plenty of frustrated developers running into the same wall:

- issue1:[ https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1315](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1315)

- issue2:[ https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4556](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/4556)

![](https://assets.zilliz.com/3_938c7244da.png)

The community‚Äôs frustration boils down to three pain points:

1. **Token bloat.** Every grep dump shovels massive amounts of irrelevant code into the LLM, driving up costs that scale horribly with repo size.

2. **Time tax.** You‚Äôre stuck waiting while the AI plays twenty questions with your codebase, killing focus and flow.

3. **Zero context.** Grep matches literal strings. It has no sense of meaning or relationships, so you‚Äôre effectively searching blind.

That‚Äôs why the debate matters: grep isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúold school,‚Äù it‚Äôs actively holding back AI-assisted programming.


## Claude Code vs Cursor: Why the Latter Has Better Code Context

When it comes to code context, Cursor has done a better job. From day one, Cursor has leaned into **codebase indexing**: break your repo into meaningful chunks, embed those chunks into vectors, and retrieve them semantically whenever the AI needs context. This is textbook Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applied to code, and the results speak for themselves: tighter context, fewer tokens wasted, and faster retrieval.

![](https://assets.zilliz.com/4_a9f5beb01d.png)

Claude Code, by contrast, has doubled down on simplicity. No indexes, no embeddings‚Äîjust grep. That means every search is literal string matching, with no understanding of structure or semantics. It‚Äôs fast in theory, but in practice, developers often end up sifting through haystacks of irrelevant matches before finding the one needle they actually need.

|                 | **Claude Code**                                                          | **Cursor**                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Search Accuracy | Only surfaces exact matches‚Äîmisses anything named differently.           | Finds semantically relevant code even when keywords don‚Äôt match exactly. |
| Efficiency      | Grep dumps massive blobs of code into the model, driving up token costs. | Smaller, higher-signal chunks reduce token load by 30‚Äì40%.               |
| Scalability     | Re-greps the repo every time, which slows down as projects grow.         | Indexes once, then retrieves at scale with minimal lag.                  |
| Philosophy      | Stay minimal‚Äîno extra infrastructure.                                    | Index everything, retrieve intelligently.                                |

So why hasn‚Äôt Claude (or Gemini, or Cline) followed Cursor‚Äôs lead? The reasons are partly technical and partly cultural. **Vector retrieval isn‚Äôt trivial‚Äîyou need to solve chunking, incremental updates, and large-scale indexing.** But more importantly, Claude Code is built around minimalism: no servers, no indexes, just a clean CLI. Embeddings and vector DBs don‚Äôt fit that design philosophy.

That simplicity is appealing‚Äîbut it also caps the ceiling of what Claude Code can deliver. Cursor‚Äôs willingness to invest in real indexing infrastructure is why it feels more powerful today.


## Claude Context: an Open-Source Project for Adding Semantic Code Search to Claude Code 

Claude Code is a strong tool‚Äîbut it has poor code context. Cursor solved this with codebase indexing, but Cursor is closed-source, locked behind subscriptions, and pricey for individuals or small teams.

That gap is why we started building our own open-source solution: [**Claude Context**](https://github.com/zilliztech/claude-context).

[**Claude Context**](https://github.com/zilliztech/claude-context) is an open-source MCP plugin that brings **semantic code search** to Claude Code (and any other AI coding agent that speaks MCP). Instead of brute-forcing your repo with grep, it integrates vector databases with embedding models to give LLMs _deep, targeted context_ from your entire codebase. The result: sharper retrieval, less token waste, and a far better developer experience.

Here is how we built it: 


### Technologies We Use 

**üîå Interface Layer: MCP as the Universal Connector**

We wanted this to work everywhere‚Äînot just Claude. MCP (Model Context Protocol) acts like the USB standard for LLMs, letting external tools plug in seamlessly. By packaging Claude Context as an MCP server, it works not only with Claude Code but also with Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Cline, and even Cursor.

**üóÑÔ∏è Vector Database: Zilliz Cloud**

For the backbone, we chose [Zilliz Cloud](https://zilliz.com/cloud) (a fully managed service built on [Milvus](https://milvus.io/)). It‚Äôs high-performance, cloud-native, elastic, and designed for AI workloads like codebase indexing. That means low-latency retrieval, near-infinite scale, and rock-solid reliability.

**üß© Embedding Models: Flexible by Design**Different teams have different needs, so Claude Context supports multiple embedding providers out of the box:

- **OpenAI embeddings** for stability and wide adoption.

- **Voyage embeddings** for code-specialized performance.

- **Ollama** for privacy-first local deployments.

Additional models can be slotted in as requirements evolve.

**üíª Language Choice: TypeScript**

We debated Python vs. TypeScript. TypeScript won‚Äînot just for application-level compatibility (VSCode plugins, web tooling) but also because Claude Code and Gemini CLI themselves are TypeScript-based. That makes integration seamless and keeps the ecosystem coherent.


### System Architecture

Claude Context follows a clean, layered design:

- **Core modules** handle the heavy lifting: code parsing, chunking, indexing, retrieval, and synchronization.

- **User interface** handles integrations‚ÄîMCP servers, VSCode plugins, or other adapters.

![](https://assets.zilliz.com/5_0c70864d6f.png)

This separation keeps the core engine reusable across different environments while letting integrations evolve quickly as new AI coding assistants emerge.


### Core Module Implementation

The core modules form the foundation of the entire system. They abstract vector databases, embedding models, and other components into composable modules that create a Context object, enabling different vector databases and embedding models for different scenarios.

```
import { Context, MilvusVectorDatabase, OpenAIEmbedding } from '@zilliz/claude-context-core';
// Initialize embedding provider
const embedding = new OpenAIEmbedding(...);
// Initialize vector database
const vectorDatabase = new MilvusVectorDatabase(...);
// Create context instance
const context = new Context({embedding, vectorDatabase});
// Index your codebase with progress tracking
const stats = await context.indexCodebase('./your-project');
// Perform semantic search
const results = await context.semanticSearch('./your-project', 'vector database operations');
```

## Solving Key Technical Challenges

Building Claude Context wasn‚Äôt just about wiring up embeddings and a vector DB. The real work came in solving the hard problems that make or break code indexing at scale. Here‚Äôs how we approached the three biggest challenges:


### Challenge 1: Intelligent Code Chunking

Code can‚Äôt just be split by lines or characters. That creates messy, incomplete fragments and strips away the logic that makes code understandable.

We solved this with **two complementary strategies**:


#### AST-Based Chunking (Primary Strategy)

This is the default approach, using tree-sitter parsers to understand code syntax structure and split along semantic boundaries: functions, classes, methods. This delivers:

- **Syntax completeness** ‚Äì no chopped functions or broken declarations.

- **Logical coherence** ‚Äì related logic stays together for better semantic retrieval.

- **Multi-language support** ‚Äì works across JS, Python, Java, Go, and more via tree-sitter grammars.

![](https://assets.zilliz.com/6_e976593d7e.png)

#### LangChain Text Splitting (Fallback Strategy)

For languages that AST can't parse or when parsing fails, LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` provides a reliable backup.

```
// Use recursive character splitting to maintain code structure
const splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.fromLanguage(language, { 
  chunkSize: 1000, 
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});
```
It‚Äôs less ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù than AST, but highly reliable‚Äîensuring developers are never left stranded. Together, these two strategies balance semantic richness with universal applicability.


### Challenge 2: Handling Code Changes Efficiently

Managing code changes represents one of the biggest challenges in code indexing systems. Re-indexing entire projects for minor file modifications would be completely impractical.

To solve this problem, we built the Merkle Tree-based synchronization mechanism.


#### Merkle Trees: The Foundation of Change Detection

Merkle Trees create a hierarchical "fingerprint" system where each file has its own hash fingerprint, folders have fingerprints based on their contents, and everything culminates in a unique root node fingerprint for the entire codebase.

![](https://assets.zilliz.com/7_79adb21c84.png)

When file content changes, the hash fingerprints cascade upward through each layer to the root node. This enables rapid change detection by comparing hash fingerprints layer by layer from the root downward, quickly identifying and localizing file modifications without full project re-indexing.

The system performs handshake synchronization checks every 5 minutes using a streamlined three-phase process:

**Phase 1: Lightning-Fast Detection** calculates the entire codebase's Merkle root hash and compares it with the previous snapshot. Identical root hashes mean no changes occurred‚Äîthe system skips all processing in milliseconds.

**Phase 2: Precise Comparison** triggers when root hashes differ, performing detailed file-level analysis to identify exactly which files were added, deleted, or modified.

**Phase 3: Incremental Updates** recalculates vectors only for changed files and updates the vector database accordingly, maximizing efficiency.


#### Local Snapshot Management

All synchronization state persists locally in the user's `~/.context/merkle/` directory. Each codebase maintains its own independent snapshot file containing file hash tables and serialized Merkle tree data, ensuring accurate state recovery even after program restarts.

This design delivers obvious benefits: most checks complete in milliseconds when no changes exist, only genuinely modified files trigger reprocessing (avoiding massive computational waste), and state recovery works flawlessly across program sessions.

From a user experience perspective, modifying a single function triggers re-indexing for only that file, not the entire project, dramatically improving development efficiency.


### Challenge 3: Designing the MCP Interface

Even the smartest indexing engine is useless without a clean developer-facing interface. MCP was the obvious choice, but it introduced unique challenges:


#### **üîπ Tool Design: Keep It Simple**

The MCP module serves as the user-facing interface, making user experience the top priority.

Tool design starts with abstracting standard codebase indexing and search operations into two core tools: `index_codebase` for indexing codebases and `search_code` for searching code.

This raises an important question: what additional tools are necessary?

The tool count requires careful balance‚Äîtoo many tools create cognitive overhead and confuse LLM tool selection, while too few might miss essential functionality.

Working backward from real-world use cases helps answer this question.


#### Addressing Background Processing Challenges

Large codebases can take considerable time to index. The naive approach of synchronously waiting for completion forces users to wait several minutes, which is simply unacceptable. Asynchronous background processing becomes essential, but MCP doesn't natively support this pattern.

![8.png](https://assets.zilliz.com/8_e1f0aa290f.png)

Our MCP server runs a background process within the MCP server to handle indexing while immediately returning startup messages to users, allowing them to continue working.

![9.png](https://assets.zilliz.com/9_1cb37d15f3.png)

This creates a new challenge: how do users track indexing progress?

A dedicated tool for querying indexing progress or status solves this elegantly. The background indexing process asynchronously caches progress information, enabling users to check completion percentages, success status, or failure conditions at any time. Additionally, a manual index clearing tool handles situations where users need to reset inaccurate indexes or restart the indexing process.

**Final Tool Design:**

`index_codebase` - Index codebase
`search_code` - Search code
`get_indexing_status` - Query indexing status
`clear_index` - Clear index

Four tools that strike the perfect balance between simplicity and functionality.


#### üîπ Environment Variable Management

Environment variable management often gets overlooked despite significantly impacting user experience. Requiring separate API key configuration for every MCP Client would force users to configure credentials multiple times when switching between Claude Code and Gemini CLI.

A global configuration approach eliminates this friction by creating a `~/.context/.env` file in the user's home directory:

```
# ~/.context/.env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
MILVUS_TOKEN=your-milvus-token
```

**This approach delivers clear benefits:** users configure once and use everywhere across all MCP clients, all configurations centralize in a single location for easy maintenance, and sensitive API keys don't scatter across multiple configuration files.

We also implements a three-tier priority hierarchy: process environment variables take highest priority, global configuration files have medium priority, and default values serve as fallbacks. 

This design offers tremendous flexibility: developers can use environment variables for temporary testing overrides, production environments can inject sensitive configurations through system environment variables for enhanced security, and users configure once to work seamlessly across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other tools.

At this point, the MCP server's core architecture is complete, spanning code parsing and vector storage through intelligent retrieval and configuration management. Every component has been carefully designed and optimized to create a system that's both powerful and user-friendly.


## Hands-on Testing

So how does Claude Context actually perform in practice? I tested it against the exact same bug-hunting scenario that initially left me frustrated.

Installation was just one command before launching Claude Code:

```
claude mcp add claude-context -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key -e MILVUS_TOKEN=your-zilliz-cloud-api-key -- npx @zilliz/claude-context-mcp@latest
```

Once my codebase was indexed, I gave Claude Code the same bug description that had previously sent it on a **five-minute grep-powered goose chase**. This time, through `claude-context` MCP calls, it **immediately pinpointed the exact file and line number**, complete with an explanation of the issue.

![](https://assets.zilliz.com/10_8ab57acba4.png)

The difference wasn‚Äôt subtle‚Äîit was night and day.

And it wasn‚Äôt just bug hunting. With Claude Context integrated, Claude Code consistently produced higher-quality results across:

- **Issue resolution**

- **Code refactoring**

- **Duplicate code detection**

- **Comprehensive testing**

The performance boost shows up in the numbers, too. In side-by-side testing:

- Token usage dropped by over 40%, without any loss in recall.

- That translates directly into lower API costs and faster responses.

- Alternatively, with the same budget, Claude Context delivered far more accurate retrievals.
