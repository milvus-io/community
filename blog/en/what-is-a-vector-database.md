Let's face it: parsing documents is hard—really hard. PDFs, images, reports, tables, messy handwriting; they're packed with valuable information that your users want to search for, but extracting that information and express that accurately in your search index is like solving a puzzle where the pieces keep changing shape: you thought you've solved it with an extra line of code but tomorrow a new doc gets ingested and you find another corner case to deal with.

In this post, we'll tackle this challenge head-on using the powerful combo of Mistral OCR and Milvus Vector DB, turning your doc parsing nightmares into a calm dream with searchable, semantically meaningful vector embeddings. 


## Why Rule-based Parsing Just Won't Cut It

If you've ever struggled with standard OCR tools, you probably know that they have all sorts of issues:

- **Complex layouts**: Tables, lists, multi-column formats -- they can break or pose issues to most parsers.
- **Semantic ambiguity**: Keywords alone don't tell you if "apple" means fruit or company.
- The chanllege of scale and cost: Processing thousands of documents becomes painfully slow.

We need a smarter, more systematic approach that doesn’t just extract text—it _understands_ the content. And that’s exactly where Mistral OCR and Milvus come in.


## Meet Your Dream Team

### Mistral OCR: More than just text extraction

Mistral OCR isn’t your average OCR tool. It's designed to tackle a wide range of documents.

- **Deep Understanding of Complex Documents**: Whether it's embedded images, mathematical equations, or tables, it can understand it all with a very high accuracy.
- **Keeps original layouts:** Not only does it understand the different layouts in the documents, it also keeps the original layouts and structure intact. On top of that, it's also capable of parsing multi-page documents.
- **Multilingual and Multimodal Mastery**: From English to Hindi to Arabic, Mistral OCR can comprehend documents across thousands of languages and scripts, making it invaluable for applications targeting a global user base.


### Milvus: Your Vector Database Built for Scale

- **Billion+ Scale**: [Milvus](https://milvus.io/) can scale to billions of vectors, making it perfect for storing large-scale documents.
- **Full-Text Search: In addition to supporting dense vector embeddings**, Milvus also supports Full Text Search. Making it easy to run queries using text and get better results for your RAG system.


## Examples:

Let's take this handwritten note in English, for example. Using a regular OCR tool to extract this text would be a very hard task.

![A handwritten note in English ](https://assets.zilliz.com/A_handwritten_note_in_English_3bbc40dee7.png)

We process it with Mistral OCR

```python
api_key = os.getenv("MISTRAL_API_KEY")
client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

url = "https://preview.redd.it/ocr-for-handwritten-documents-v0-os036yiv9xod1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=29461b68383534a3c1bf76cc9e36a2ba4de13c86"
result = client.ocr.process(
                model=ocr_model, document={"type": "image_url", "image_url": url}
            )
print(f"Result: {result.pages[0].markdown}")
```

And we get the following output. It can recognize handwritten text well. We can see that it even keeps the capitalized format of the words "FORCED AND UNNATURAL"!

```Markdown
Today is Thursday, October 20th - But it definitely feels like a Friday. I'm already considering making a second cup of coffee - and I haven't even finished my first. Do I have a problem?
Sometimes I'll fly through older notes I've taken, and my handwriting is unrecamptable. Perhaps it depends on the type of pen I use. I've tried writing in all cups but it looks so FORCED AND UNNATURAL.
Often times, I'll just take notes on my lapten, but I still seem to ermittelt forward pen and paper. Any advice on what to
improve? I already feel stressed at looking back at what I've just written - it looks like I different people wrote this!
```

Now we can then insert the text into Milvus for semantic search.

```
from pymilvus import MilvusClient 

COLLECTION_NAME = "document_ocr"

milvus_client = MilvusClient(uri='http://localhost:19530')
"""
This is where you would define the index, create a collection etc. For the sake of this example. I am skipping it. 

schema = CollectionSchema(...)

milvus_client.create_collection(
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    schema=schema,
    )

"""

milvus_client.insert(collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME, data=[result.pages[0].markdown])
```

But Mistral can also understand documents in different languages or in more complex format, for example let's try this invoice in German that combines some item names in English.

![An Invoice in German](https://assets.zilliz.com/An_Invoice_in_German_994e204d49.png)

Mistral OCR is still capable of extracting all the information you have and it even creates the table structure in Markdown that represents the table from the scanned image.

## Real-World Usage: A Case Study

Now that we've seen that Mistral OCR can work on different documents, we could imagine how a legal firm that is drowning in case files and contracts leverage this tool. By implementing a RAG system with Mistral OCR and Milvus, what once took a paralegal countless hours, like manually scanning for specific clauses or comparing past cases, now is done by AI in only a couple of minutes.
