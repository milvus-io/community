Your IDE is bloated. Your coding assistant is outdated. And you're still stuck right-clicking to refactor? Welcome to the CLI renaissance.

AI code assistants are evolving from gimmicks to go-to tools and developers are taking sides. Beyond the startup sensation Cursor, **Anthropic’s** [**Claude Code**](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) brings precision and polish. Google’s [**Gemini CLI**](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)? Fast, free, and hungry for context. Both promise to make natural language the new shell scripting. So which one should _you_ trust to refactor your next repo?

From what I’ve seen, Claude Code had the early lead. But the game changed fast. After Gemini CLI launched, developers flocked to it—**racking up 15.1k GitHub stars within 24 hours.** As of now, it’s soared past **55,000 stars** and counting. Amazing!

Here's my quick takeaway on why so many developers are excited about Gemini CLI:

- **It's open source under Apache 2.0 and completely free:** Gemini CLI connects to Google's top-tier Gemini 2.0 Flash model at no cost. Simply log in with your personal Google account to access Gemini Code Assist. During the preview period, you get up to 60 requests per minute and 1,000 daily requests—all free of charge.

- **It's a true multi-task powerhouse:** Beyond programming (its strongest suit), it handles file management, content generation, script control, and even Deep Research capabilities.

- **It's lightweight:** You can seamlessly embed it in terminal scripts or use it as a standalone agent.

- **It offers long context length:** With 1 million tokens of context (roughly 750,000 words), it can ingest entire codebases for smaller projects in a single pass.


## Why Developers Are Ditching IDEs for AI-Powered Terminals

Why is there such enthusiasm for these terminal-based tools? As developers, you've probably felt this pain: Traditional IDEs pack impressive features, but they come with workflow complexity that kills momentum. Want to refactor a single function? You need to select the code, right-click for the context menu, navigate to "Refactor," choose the specific refactoring type, configure options in a dialog box, and finally apply changes.

**Terminal AI tools have changed this workflow by streamlining all operations into natural language commands.** Instead of memorizing command syntax, you simply say: "_Help me refactor this function to improve readability,_" and watch as the tool handles the entire process.

This isn't just convenience—it's a fundamental shift in how we think. Complex technical operations become natural language conversations, freeing us to focus on business logic rather than the mechanics of tools.


## Claude Code or Gemini CLI? Choose Your Co-Pilot Wisely

Since Claude Code is also quite popular and easy to use and has previously dominated adoption, how does it compare to the new Gemini CLI? How should we choose between the two? Let's take a closer look at these AI coding tools.


### **1. Cost: Free vs Paid**

- **Gemini CLI** is completely free with any Google account, providing 1,000 requests per day and 60 requests per minute, with no billing setup required.

- **Claude Code** requires an active Anthropic subscription and follows a pay-per-use model, but includes enterprise-level security and support that's valuable for commercial projects.


### **2. Context Window: How Much Code Can It See?**

- **Gemini CLI:** 1 million tokens (roughly 750,000 words)

- **Claude Code:** Approximately 200,000 tokens (about 150,000 words)

Larger context windows enable models to reference more input content when generating responses. They also help maintain conversation coherence in multi-turn dialogues, giving the model better memory of your entire conversation.

Essentially, Gemini CLI can analyze your entire small-to-medium project in a single session, making it ideal for comprehending large codebases and cross-file relationships. Claude Code works better when you're focusing on specific files or functions.


### **3. Code Quality vs Speed**

- Explore tool integrations by connecting external tools with MCP servers

- Enhance search capabilities by using built-in Google search for up-to-date information


## AI Code is Outdated on Arrival. Here’s How to Fix it with Milvus

_AI coding tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI are powerful—but they have a blind spot:_ **_they don’t know what’s current_**_._

_The reality? Most models generate outdated patterns straight out of the box. They were trained months ago, sometimes years. So while they can generate code quickly, they can’t guarantee that it reflects_ **_your latest APIs_**_, frameworks, or SDK versions._

**Real example:**

Ask Cursor how to connect to Milvus, and you might get this:

```
connections.connect("default", host="localhost", port="19530")
```

Looks fine, except that method’s now deprecated. The recommended approach is to use  `MilvusClient` but most assistants don’t know that yet. 

Or take OpenAI’s own API. Many tools still suggest `gpt-3.5-turbo` via `openai.ChatCompletion`, a method deprecated in March 2024. It’s slower, costs more, and delivers worse results. But the LLM doesn’t know that.

### The Fix: Real-Time Intelligence with Milvus MCP + RAG

To solve this, we combined two powerful ideas:

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A standard for agentic tools to interact with live systems through natural language

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Fetches the freshest, most relevant content—on demand

Together, they make your assistant smarter and current.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfz_fAtAMd0Lr6mJvmUN4RnnxGfYKqMRMCBYvWQpvXQir8k4LrseJkC1q9aV6JXwYjFbcy11fcG9KrK_6X4pOMBOFp92-3vAP9kn6kzaLwcHppINCGSDPVw47Z3dWO5k7fgr0G3-g?key=6LcI6MfTDQQ7drjMVXX9kw)

**Here’s how it works:**

1. Preprocess your documentation, SDK references, and API guides

2. Store them as vector embeddings in [**Milvus**](https://milvus.io/), our open-source vector database

3. When a dev asks a question (e.g. “How do I connect to Milvus?”), the system:

   - Runs a **semantic search**

   - Retrieves the most relevant docs and examples
   
   - Injects them into the assistant’s prompt context



4. Result: code suggestions that reflect **exactly what’s true right now**


### Live Code, Live Docs

With the **Milvus MCP Server**, you can plug this flow directly into your coding environment. Assistants get smarter. Code gets better. Devs stay in flow.

And it’s not just theoretical—we’ve battle-tested this against other setups like Cursor’s Agent Mode, Context7, and DeepWiki. The difference? Milvus + MCP doesn't just summarize your project—it stays in sync with it.

## The Future of Coding is Conversational—And It's Happening Right Now

The terminal AI revolution is just beginning. As these tools mature, we'll likely see even tighter integration with development workflows, better code quality, and solutions to the currency problem through approaches like MCP+RAG.

Whether you choose Claude Code for its quality or Gemini CLI for its accessibility and power, one thing is clear: **natural language programming is here to stay.** The question isn't whether to adopt these tools, but how to integrate them effectively into your development workflow.

We're witnessing a fundamental shift from memorizing syntax to having conversations with our code. **The future of coding is conversational—and it's happening right now in your terminal.**
