Various [new essential features](https://milvus.io/blog/2022-1-27-milvus-2-0-a-glimpse-at-new-features.md) of a vector database are provided together with the [release](https://milvus.io/blog/2022-1-25-annoucing-general-availability-of-milvus-2-0.md) of Milvus 2.0. Among the new features, [Time Travel](https://milvus.io/docs/v2.0.0/timetravel_ref.md), attribute filtering, and [delete operations](https://milvus.io/blog/2022-02-07-how-milvus-deletes-streaming-data-in-distributed-cluster.md) are correlated as these three features are achieved by one common mechanism - bitset.

Therefore, this article aims to clarify the concept of bitset in Milvus and explain how it works to support delete operations, Time Travel, and attribute filtering with three examples.

## What is bitset?

A bitset is an array of bit numbers ("0" and "1") that can be used to represent certain data information. With bitsets, you can store certain types of data compactly and efficiently as opposed to store them in Ints, floats, or chars. Bitsets work on [boolean logic](https://milvus.io/docs/v2.0.0/boolean.md), according to which the value of an output is either valid or invalid, usually denoted by "1" and "0" respectively. "1" stands for valid, and "0" for invalid. Since bitsets are highly efficient and can save storage, they can also be used to achieve many features such as attribute filtering, delete operations, Time Travel, and more.

Starting from version 0.7.0, the concept of bitset has been introduced in Milvus to enable the [delete function](https://milvus.io/blog/deleting-data-in-milvus.md?page=6#all). More specifically, bitset is used to mark if each row in the segment is deleted. Deleted entities are marked with "1" in the corresponding bitset, and as a result, the deleted entities will not be computed during a search or query.

In the Milvus 2.0 version, the application of bitset is extended to enable more features, like attribute filtering and Time Travel. The general principle in a bitset remains the same. That is, if an entity is marked with "1" in the corresponding bitset, the entity will be ignored during a search or query. Bitsets are used to enable 3 features in Milvus:

- Attribute filtering
- Data deletion
- Query with Time Travel

## How does bitset work in Milvus?

The examples below are used to illustrate how bitset works in Milvus.

### Prerequisites

Suppose there is a segment with eight entities and a series of data manipulation language (DML) events happens in the order shown in the figure below.

- Four of the entities, whose `primary_keys` are \[1, 2, 3, 4] respectively, are inserted when the timestamp `ts` equals 100. 
- The remaining four entities, whose `primary_keys` are \[5, 6, 7, 8], are inserted when the timestamp `ts` equals 200. 
- Entities whose `primary_keys` are \[7, 8] are deleted when the timestamp `ts` equals 300. 
- Only entities, whose `primary_keys` are \[1, 3, 5, 7], satisfy the conditions of attribute filtering.

### Case one

Suppose the value a user sets for `time_travel` is 150. In other words, the user conducts a query on the data stored in Milvus when `ts` = 150. The bitset generation process is illustrated by Figure 1. 

During the initial filtering stage, the result of the `filter_bitset` should be \[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0] as entities \[1, 3, 5, 7] are valid filtering results and marked as "1" in the bitset. However, entities \[4, 5, 6, 7] were not even inserted to the vector database when `ts` equals 150. Therefore, these four entities should be marked as "0" regardless of the filtering condition. Now the bitset result should be \[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Since in Milvus, the general principle of bitset computing is that entities marked with "1" in the bitset are ignored during a search or query, the bitset result after Time Travel and attribute filtering needs to be flipped in order to be combined with the deletion bitmap. The flipped result of `filter_bitset` should be \[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

As for the deletion bitset `del_bitset`, the initial value should be \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]. However, entities 7 and 8 are not deleted until `ts` is 300. Therefore, when `ts` is 150, entities 7 and 8 are still valid. As a result, the `del_bitset` value after Time Travel should be \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. 

Now we have two bitsets after Time Travel and attribute filtering: `filter_bitset` \[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and `del_bitset` \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].  Combine these two bitsets with the "OR" binary logic operator. The ultimate value of `result_bitset` is \[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. That is to say, only entities 1 and 3 will be computed in the following search or query stage.

### Case two

Suppose the value the user sets for `time_travel` is 250. In other words, the user conducts a query on the data stored in Milvus when `ts` = 250. The bitset generation process is illustrated by Figure 2. 

Like in case one, the resultant `filter_bitset` of the initial attribute filtering stage should be \[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. 

All entities \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] are inserted to the vector database when `ts`= 250. Therefore, the previous result of `filter_bitset` remains the same. Again, we need to flip the result of the `filter_bitset`, and we will get \[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1].

As for the deletion bitset `del_bitset`, the initial value should be \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]. However, entities 7 and 8 were not deleted until `ts` is 300. Therefore, when `ts` is 250, entities 7 and 8 are still valid. As a result, the `del_bitset` value after Time Travel should be \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. 

Now we have two bitsets after Time Travel and attribute filtering: `filter_bitset` \[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1] and `del_bitset` \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].  Combine these two bitsets with the "OR" binary logic operator. The ultimate value of `result_bitset` is \[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. That is to say, only entities \[1, 3, 5, 7] will be computed in the following search or query stage.

### Case three

Suppose the value the user sets for `time_travel` is 350. In other words, the user conducts a query on the data stored in Milvus when `ts` = 350. The bitset generation process is illustrated by Figure 3. 

Same as case one and two, the resultant `filter_bitset` of the initial attribute filtering stage is \[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]. 

All entities \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] are inserted to the vector database when `ts`= 350. Therefore, the final flipped result of the `filter_bitset` is \[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], the same as in case two.

As for the deletion bitset `del_bitset`, since entities 7 and 8 are already deleted when `ts`=350, therefore, the result of `del_bitset` should be \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1].

Now we have two bitsets after Time Travel and attribute filtering: `filter_bitset` \[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1] and `del_bitset` \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1].  Combine these two bitsets with the "OR" binary logic operator. The ultimate value of `result_bitset` is \[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. That is to say, only entities \[1, 3, 5] will be computed in the following search or query stage.
